# subcycle
App for menstrual cycle tracking, which monitors menstruation, ovulation, and contraceptive pill usage, while predicting your next cycle events for better planning and health management.

## Usage
On the top you can see which part of your menstrual cycle you're in.

In the middle is the calendar, in which you see past events and future predictions. To edit events, tap on the date, and a popup with edit options will show. Scroll the calendar sideways to move between months of the year. Tapping on the calendar header will reset the view to current month.

On the bottom is a checkbox for daily pill usage - after taking the pill, tap it to save event to the calendar.
